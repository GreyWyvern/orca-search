* Orca Search JPEG indexing plugin - Installation guide                *
************************************************************************

This plugin will enable the Orca Search script to index JPEG files.
This plugin will *not* turn your search script into a Google Images
clone.  Rather, the plugin will try to extract APP13 image information
from JPEGs to which it finds links.

The VAST MAJORITY of JPEG images online will contain no data, but if you
are indexing photographs for which someone has lovingly taken the time
to add descriptive information to each image, this plugin may be useful
to you.

To install, just upload the index.jpg.php file to the os2/plugins/
directory and include the file in your "config.ini.php" file:

include "plugins/index.jpg.php";

The next step is to enable indexing of the jpeg MIME-type in the Spider
Panel (image/jpeg).  Since the script creates temporary files while
indexing, the os2/temp/ directory needs to have script writing
permissions enabled.  That's CHMOD 777 on *nix servers.

If there are no more visible error messages after submitting, the
extension is functional!  Linked JPEGs should now be grabbed and indexed
during the next spider crawl.

IMPORTANT: you should double check your URI ignoring and filtering rules
in the Spider Panel to make sure your soon-to-be-indexed JPEGs will not
be blocked.  The Orca Search comes with the jpg, jpeg and jfif
extensions blocked by default; you will need to manually remove these
extensions from the list of Ignored Extensions.
